            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hey there! I'm Divyadeep Mishra, a B.Tech Computer Science student at Lovely Professional University
                (LPU). I've
                always had a passion for tech, and right now, I'm diving deep into web development. I work on both
                front-end and back-end development as part of my full-stack journey, and I love the challenge of
                building seamless, user-friendly applications.

                Beyond web development, I'm excited about the endless possibilities in AI, Machine Learning, and
                Robotics, and how these fields can shape the future. I'm also exploring app development, creating mobile
                apps that are both functional and fun to use.</p>

    <div id="project">
        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <h4>• Rc Bot car</h4>
        I had the opportunity to develop a boat car for the Sumo Car Competition, which we proudly showcased at Pushpa
        Gujral Science City. This project was a great hands-on experience, where I worked on
        designing and integrating motors, sensors, and using design software to bring our prototype to life. It was an
        exciting challenge that helped me grow my skills in robotics, mechanics, and, most importantly, teamwork. The
        whole process was not just about technical learning, but also about collaborating with others to solve problems
        creatively.
        
        <h4>• Travelling Website</h4>
        As part of my web development journey, I'm building a travel website aimed at giving users an easy and enjoyable
        way to plan and book their trips. While the project is still in its early stages, it's already helping me grow
        my skills in both front-end and back-end development. I've been working with technologies like HTML, CSS,
        JavaScript, and Node.js to create a user-friendly interface and solid functionality. This project has also given
        me the chance to experiment with API integration, database management, and optimizing the overall user
        experience. I'm excited to keep improving and adding new features as I continue developing it.
        <h4>• To-do list Web Application</h4>
        I created a To-Do List web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to help me better manage and prioritize
        my tasks. This project was a great way to deepen my understanding of these web development technologies while
        building something practical. I added features like task prioritization and the ability to delete completed
        tasks, which made it easier for me to stay organized. It was not only a useful tool for personal task management
        but also an invaluable learning experience. Working on this project helped me improve my coding skills and gave
        me more confidence in my web development abilities.

        <h2>Work Experience</h2>
        <h4>• Coordinator</h4>
        I had the privilege of being the Coordinator for the Medha event at LPU, where I helped organize and oversee a
        24-hour Hackathon under the Department of Student Research and Projects. My responsibilities included managing
        logistics, coordinating with teams, and making sure everything ran smoothly. It was incredibly rewarding to see
        the event come together successfully, and I'm proud to have contributed to its success.
        <h4>• Member</h4>
        As a member of the Coding Blocks club at LPU, under the Department of Student Organisation, I had the
        opportunity to contribute to various events and initiatives. One of the highlights was being part of the Miraj
        2024 event, where I was responsible for marketing and promoting the event. From crafting campaigns to reaching
        out to potential participants, I played an active role in generating excitement and engagement. It was an
        amazing experience, and seeing the event turn into a huge success for us was incredibly rewarding. I'm grateful
        for the chance to collaborate with such a talented team.
